# Evolution of NJ House Prices

## Essential Question
How have house prices evolved across New Jersey over the past 10-20 years, and how do they compare to median incomes over time?

## Project Overview
This project explores the evolution of house prices across New Jersey over the past 10-20 years. It also examines how these trends compare with median income trends during the same period. Through data analysis and visualization, the project aims to shed light on housing affordability and market dynamics.

## Data Sources
- **Zillow Research Data**  
  [Zillow Research](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/)  
  Provides historical housing prices by city, county, and zip code.

  Some csv files I plan on using:
  [New HomeOwner Income Needed](https://github.com/mizm13/Data-Visualization---Checkpoint-1/blob/main/Metro_new_homeowner_income_needed_downpayment_0.20_uc_sfrcondo_tier_0.33_0.67_sm_sa_month.csv)
  [House Values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mizm13/Data-Visualization---Checkpoint-1/refs/heads/main/Metro_zhvi_uc_sfrcondo_tier_0.33_0.67_sm_sa_month.csv)

- **Kaggle Housing Market Datasets**  
  [Kaggle Housing Market Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madhurpant/factors-affecting-usa-national-home-prices?resource=download)  
  Contains historical prices, affordability indices, and more factors affecting national home prices.

## Visualization Approach
The project will use various charts to bring the data to life:
- **Line Charts:** To display housing price trends over time.
- **Scatter Plots:** To compare house prices with median incomes.
- **Interactive Charts:** Allowing users to filter data by city, time period, or other variables.
